# cineio-broadcast-ios-swift-example-app

Sample iOS application (written in Swift) to demonstrate broadcasting and playback
using the [cine.io Broadcast iOS SDK][cineio-broadcast-ios].

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a cineio-settings.plist file based on the SAMPLE-cineio-
   settings.plist file. You'll need to create a (free) account at
   [cine.io][cine].
3. Change into the `SwiftExample` directory: `cd SwiftExample`
4. Install the necessary CocoaPods: `pod install`
5. Build and run the project as you usually would, making sure to use the `.xcworkspace` file and not the `.xcproject` file when building using `xcodebuild` or when opening with XCode.
